Let's assume that i'm working in a real estate agency who wants to understand very well the real estate market in Toulouse and its suburbs. I am the data analyst of the company and i have access to a 5-years real data history of houses and apartments sales transactions in Toulouse and its suburbs. 

The dataset contains details for each transaction: sale date, localization (city, postal code), type of residence, type of sale, land area, living area, number of rooms,
price, etc.).
I will use Spark for this analysis because i should be able to apply this analysis to a dataset with the entire real estate market in France for instance (big data file). But for presenting my key results, i will of course use python visualization libraries such as seaborn or other librairies.
Challenges here are to explore all possible aspects of this real estate market (variables, relationships between variables, trends, patterns, outliers, etc.). But at the end i will focus on 5 keys findings (tables or visualizations)in my final notebook. I will also comment these findings. 

I will explore for instance:
* **The evolution of the prices (e.g. price per square meter)**
* **Identification of sales outliers**
* **Differences of prices per cities or postal codes**
* **Differences between apartment and houses**
* **Differences between types of sales**
* **Differences between Toulouse and its suburbs**
* **High cost, low cost or emerging cities**
